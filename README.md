# Git Commit Message Rule
After performing the **`git add .`** command, the **`git commit`** message should follow this structure:

    git commit -m "[folder/file updated] - [task description]"

**Example:**
    
    git commit -m "DataPreprocessing/preprocess.ipynb - handling missing values"

Task description should provide enough information for other members to understand what was updated or changed, e.g., fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code.

After that, use the **`git push`** command to push into the GitHub repository.
